# Advent Of Code

This repo contains (some) answers to the puzzles from the [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge. The code is written in
[Guile](https://www.gnu.org/s/guile/).

# Why Guile?

Because it's a lot of fun! It makes you think diferently than you are probably
used to and I just want to learn and practice more with it.

Happy Hacking!
